JTS Topology Suite
==================
     
Welcome to the repository for the JTS Topology Suite.
JTS consists of several Java modules,
each one corresponding to a separate JAR file.
Only the jts-core.jar is necessary to use the library in an application.
The others are external tools or optional extensions.
